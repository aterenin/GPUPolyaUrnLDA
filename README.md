This is a work-in-progress repository for a GPU implementation of [Pólya Urn LDA](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.03581).

The techniques used here are the subject of a forthcoming paper.

This software currently does NOT work. If you want to run topic models, use [PCLDA](https://github.com/lejon/PartiallyCollapsedLDA).
